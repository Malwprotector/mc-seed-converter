<strong>Minecraft seed converter</strong>

There are two different editions of the Minecraft video game, the Minecraft Java Edition and the Minecraft Bedrock Edition. This particularity includes a fairly significant problem, world saves cannot be converted from one edition to the other: however, when you create a save, a generation seed is associated with it and is used to generate a Minecraft world.

This tool allows you to convert Minecraft world generation seeds from the Bedrock Edition to the Java Edition, and vice versa.
When using the tool, note that: 


-All Minecraft Bedrock generation seeds can be converted to Java seeds.<br>
-You will not be able to convert all Minecraft Java Edition seeds to Minecraft Bedrock seeds.<br>
-There will be some differences in the world generated.<br>
-The appearance points will probably be different.<br>
-Structures such as Desert Temples, Jungle Temples, mine shafts and fortresses will not be in the same place.<br>
-The biomes and map will be close to the seed of the original world.<br>
